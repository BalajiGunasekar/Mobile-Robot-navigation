 Autonomous Navigation of mobile robot using A star algorithm
 
 Hello,

This is a simple pyhton implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding on a two-dimensional grid od size 5 x 5. I have used heapq library for stacking the explored path. Here the algorithm estimates the path of the robot (Estimated Path) and also compare the actual path followed by the robot(Robot Path) this helps in debugging real-time error caused while operating the robot. I used google colab for this project so you can the attached files in .ipynb format

Language : Python 
Grid size : 5x5
